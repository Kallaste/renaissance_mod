---   NOTE on avoiding OoS errors in multiplayer mode             ---

---   Do not edit the config.ini file if you want to play a       ---
---   multiplayer game. In 99% or all cases, an edited            ---
---   config.ini file will lead to an out-of-sync error.          ---
---   Additionally, we advise you to run the game as an           --- 
---   administrator and to add The Guild 2 - Renaissance to the   ---
---   list of exceptions in your firewall.                        ---
---   Also ensure that you have full access rights to the         ---
---   installation folder of The Guild 2 - Renaissance.           ---
---                                                               ---

---   As a good prevention against crashes especially with        ---
---   Windows 7 the compatibility mode has been proved.           ---
---   Therefor you have to set compatibility mode for your        ---
---   GuildII.exe or for the desktop link under                   ---
---   properties -> compatibility to Windows XP (SP 3)/Vista.     ---

---	  Note on the savegames									      ---
---																  ---
---   To avoid crashes and corrupted savegames, we recommend      ---
---   not to overwrite old savegames, but to create a new         ---
---   savegame.                                                   ---

---   We were able to obtain the services of the famous German    ---
---   medieval band "Versengold" (http://versengold.de) for       ---
---   several in-game performances. They play three of their      ---
---   pieces in the taverns and inns of                           ---

---   The ModLauncher allows mods to be easily installed in       ---
---   The Guild 2 - Renaissance, without losing original files    ---

---   The ModLauncher.exe can be found in the installation        ---
---   folder of The Guild 2 - Renaissance and should be launched  ---
---   before starting the actual game.                            ---
---   Modders can make their The Guild 2 - Renaissance mods       ---
---   available for the ModLauncher in a few easy steps.          ---
---   Instructions on how to do so can be found in the            ---
---   ModLauncher itself.                                         ---

Changelog:
----------------

4.211

*** Fixed Bugs ***

- The new feature "Frequency of Councilmeetings" didn't work properly
- AI didn't have to respect cooldowns during the measures "Press Protection Money" and "Offer Building Protection"
- Fixed a Bug in the Voodoo-Doll-Script
- Some measures couldn't be used because some targets like buildings were "too young"
- During trials the evidence now correctly expires if the accuser doesn't appear
- The AI of taverns and divehouses didn't work properly because of the "Versengold"-measure
- Like in 4.2 now only the applicant can use measures during the council session.
- Thesis papers had a much higher range if you used it via cutscene
- Fixed a small bug with the mine guards
- Fixed a small bug with the royal guards. These guards also will now not attack you if you are the king.
- As a workaround stonemasoners will now gather more Stone Blocks at once (but need more time for that). This way it's less likely that they will run between your workshop and the quarry 
  before their inventory is filled.
- Characters who have been banished now will leave buildings when their time runs out, so that the guards can do their duty.
- Male and female characters can do dance shows again
- some additional small fixes.
